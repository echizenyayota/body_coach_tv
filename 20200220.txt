We’ve landed that amazing place of a lovely kitchen in Santa Barbra called the Wayfarer. So I’ve gone down the shop.Grab some ingredients. And I want to show you how to make my banging breakfast burrito.

It’s really quick and easy.You can take it to work you know breakfast, lunch or dinner and it tastes amazing.

- "work" is the noun but it isn't the verb.


### C 0:30 - 0:39

So first things first I've boiled some potatoes you can I didn't even peel them so you confirming the microwave just to soften that for a little bit.I'll boil it in hot water sort of five to six minutes now.

- "you can"は言い間違い。なくても良い
- "you confirming"は良い間違い。正しくは"you are confirming"
- 私はじゃがいもの皮を向いていないので電子レンジで少し柔らかくしてくれ。

Now I've got some red onions just chopped up nice and Finely and with these kind of burittos you can literally put anything you want in this.

So I'm gonna be using scrambled eggs.I've got some cheese and (tomorrow) some avocado but ultimately it's like kind of build your own what everyone a friend.You could throw some bacon, some ham in there.

- finely (細く)
- 今、赤玉ねぎをきれいにみじん切りにして、文字どおり、ぶりとーの中に何でも好きなものを入れることができます。
