We’ve landed that amazing place of a lovely kitchen in Santa Barbra called the Wayfarer. So I’ve gone down the shop.Grab some ingredients. And I want to show you how to make my banging breakfast burrito.

It’s really quick and easy.You can take it to work you know breakfast, lunch or dinner and it tastes amazing.

- "work" is the noun but it isn't the verb.
